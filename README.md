This is an awful project! So bad in fact, the class dependencies confuse UE4's linker causing it to load them in the wrong order.. or not! It depends on the order the plugins are reported by the filesystem weather it will fail or not. Use the Fix and Break script files to demonstrate this using symlinks to force the loading order. Tested on UE 4.25 Linux and Windows. Good luck!
